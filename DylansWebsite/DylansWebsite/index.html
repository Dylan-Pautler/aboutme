                        <p>During most of my time in the service, I was an infantry leader. I was responsible for my team and their subordinate teams for mentoring, teaching and leading. It was an experience that founded my core fundamentals as a leader. This picture of myself was taken on a beach in South Korea, the photographer got me doing the Heisman for the next ESPY Awards.</p>

                        <p>The most amazing part of being a Marine was getting to know the people I served alongside. From first dates to thoughts about life on other planets. Every single Marine I worked with was not a coworker, they were my family. This picture is from a beach in Thailand with my family. Some of the greatest men I will ever know stood with me on that beach that day. Semper Fidelis.</p>

                        <p>After about 3.5 years in the infantry I received orders to move to the rifle range to teach recruits how to shoot. This was a new teaching experience for me because of how basically I needed to analyze each task of marksmanship. I have a passion for weapons, marksmanship and, most importantly, weapons safety. I had great fun sharing this passion with people that were motivated to learn. I found it inspiring to teach the next generation of Marines.</p>

                        <p>In additon to being a Rifle Range and Pistol Range Coach, I am a Foriegn Weapons Instructor. Again, the most important part is weapons safety, because without it, no recruit is allowed to pick up a weapon. I have a passion for all guns and love to teach people how to use them safely and effectively. My passion for guns and weapons really started when I joined the military. It's funny now because I am just as curious if not more about IT than I was about guns and weapons.</p>

                        <p>Being a baystater from Massachusetts I was exposed to some really great sports teams and the opportunity to play those sports. My favorite sports include hockey and lacrosse. Lacrosse is a great sport and is really growing across the country right now and I am very excited to see how big it gets in the future.</p>

                    <p>This was my very first day in the great state of Hawaii. I ended up on the beach of Waikiki looking at the very famous and coincidentally touristy peak named Diamondhead. This place was my home for years and I loved it. The Hawaiian people are amazing and have a wonderful culture. I look forward to going back there someday.</p>
